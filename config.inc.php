// The timezone your meeting rooms run in. It is especially important
// to set this if you're using PHP 5 on Linux. In this configuration
// if you don't, meetings in a different DST than you are currently
// in are offset by the DST offset incorrectly.
//
// Note that timezones can be set on a per-area basis, so strictly speaking this
// setting should be in areadefaults.inc.php, but as it is so important to set
// the right timezone it is included here.
//
// When upgrading an existing installation, this should be set to the
// timezone the web server runs in.  See the INSTALL document for more information.

// A list of valid timezones can be found at http://php.net/manual/timezones.php
